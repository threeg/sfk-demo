# sfk-signoff — complete a milestone (the human gate)

Run this **only when the user explicitly approves** the current milestone's deliverable. It is the one
place a milestone becomes `Complete`. `sfk-next-milestone` produced and committed the draft; this skill
records the user's sign-off and advances the project.

## Procedure

1. **Confirm approval.** Verify the user is signing off the milestone that is currently `In progress`
   (🔶) in `process/milestone-plan.md`. If they have outstanding feedback, do **not** sign off — hand
   back to `sfk-next-milestone` to revise first.

2. **Check the deliverable is committed.** The milestone's draft and any revisions should already be
   committed (by `sfk-next-milestone`). If there are uncommitted changes, commit them first.

3. **Mark it `Complete` (✅)** in `process/milestone-plan.md` and **move the *Current position*** line
   to the next milestone (or, if this was the version's last milestone, note the version is ready to
   ship/tag and that `sfk-version` starts the next one).

4. **Commit the status change**, e.g. `process: <milestone> — signed off (complete)`. This commit
   carries the status flip and the *Current position* move; the deliverable itself was already
   committed.

5. **For the implementation milestone**, sign-off means the version's tickets are all `done` and the
   gates pass; on sign-off, note that the version can be tagged (e.g. `v0.1.0`) per
   `process/README.md`.

6. **Hand off.** Tell the user what is next: `sfk-next-milestone` for the following milestone, or
   `sfk-version` if the version is complete.

## Rules

- Run only on explicit user approval. The agent never self-signs-off a milestone.
- Sign-off is a status event: it flips the milestone and moves the *Current position*, nothing else.
- If the milestone isn't actually done (open feedback, failing gates), refuse and return to
  `sfk-next-milestone` or `sfk-next-ticket`.


## Thread name

Sign-off runs in the **same thread as the milestone it completes** (`PROJCODE: <Milestone>`, e.g.
`ACME: Architecture`), so no new thread name is needed. Cowork cannot rename threads programmatically in
any case — only the user can.
