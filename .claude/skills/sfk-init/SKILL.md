description: Bootstrap the basic environment for a new spec-first project from the starter kit. Use ONCE, in an otherwise-empty repository that contains this kit. Optionally takes the project code as an argument, e.g. "/sfk-init ACME". Sets up the root CLAUDE.md, the process folder, and the gitignore; does not start any milestones. Trigger on "init", "initialise the project", "bootstrap from the starter kit", or "set up this kit".

# sfk-init — set up the project environment

Run this once, in a fresh repository that contains the starter kit. Your only job is to prepare the
working environment. You do **not** start any milestones and you do **not** write application code —
that comes later, via `sfk-version` then `sfk-next-milestone`.

**Project code.** This skill may be invoked with the project code as an argument, e.g.
`/sfk-init ACME`. The project code is a short uppercase token that serves two purposes: it is the
**ticket prefix** (`ACME` → `ACME-001`) and the **thread-name prefix** (`ACME init`, `ACME: Architecture`,
`ACME Implementation`). If an argument is supplied, use it as the project code without asking; if not,
ask for it in the interview. Record it as `project_code` in `process/.sfk/manifest.md` so every other
skill can build thread names and ticket ids from it.

## Procedure

1. **Confirm the situation.** Check that the repo contains the kit (`process/`, `.claude/skills/`) and
   little or no application code. If it looks like an already-bootstrapped project, stop and ask before
   proceeding — `sfk-init` is destructive to the templates.

2. **Short essentials interview** (one round, then proceed). Ask only what is needed to set up the
   environment — not the product itself (that is the brief, owned by `sfk-version` →
   `sfk-next-milestone`):
   - the **project code / ticket prefix** — use the argument if one was passed (e.g. `/sfk-init ACME`
     → `ACME`); otherwise ask (e.g. `ACME` → `ACME-001`);
   - project name and a one-line description;
   - the architecture layers and the one-line dependency rule (offer the kit default
     `core → domain → services → interface, storage beneath services` and let them adjust);
   - the command runner and the default-gate command (e.g. `make test`);
   - whether there is a UI (if not, note the wireframes milestone will be dropped);
   - whether to adopt the optional meta loop (default: no — see `process/addons/meta-loop/`).

3. **Lay down the environment**, adapting the templates to the answers:
   - record the project code as `project_code` in `process/.sfk/manifest.md` (it drives ticket ids and
     thread names);
   - fill the root `CLAUDE.md` — non-negotiables, the dependency rule, commands, definition of done,
     the milestone lifecycle (replace every `<PLACEHOLDER>`);
   - leave `process/milestone-plan.md` with an **empty** milestone table and a *Current position* line
     reading "Environment bootstrapped; run `sfk-version` to start v0.1.0." — the table is laid down by
     `sfk-version`, not here;
   - adapt the prefix and layer names throughout `process/tickets/` and `process/templates/`;
   - confirm `.gitignore` suits the stack (uncomment the relevant build-artefact lines).

4. **Tidy up.** Delete the placeholder guidance from any file you fully fill. Leave the per-milestone
   template docs under `process/` intact — they are filled later, milestone by milestone.

5. **Stop and hand off.** Tell the user the environment is ready and the next step is `sfk-version`
   (give it a version number and goals). Do **not** start Milestone 1.

## Rules

- Environment only. No milestones, no brief content, no application code in `sfk-init`.
- `sfk-init` runs **once** per project and may be deleted afterwards (one-time scaffolding).
- Keep `process/` the binding source of truth; never mark a milestone complete (that is `sfk-signoff`).
- The pristine templates in `process/.sfk/templates/` are the kit's reference copy for future updates
  — never edit them; `sfk-update-process` uses them to apply later kit improvements.

## Thread name

Cowork auto-titles a new thread and **cannot rename it programmatically** — only the user can rename a
thread. As your **first action**, suggest the name below and ask the user to rename this thread to it.
Use the project code passed as the argument (e.g. `/sfk-init ACME` → `ACME`).

**Suggested name:** `PROJCODE init`  (e.g. `ACME init`)
